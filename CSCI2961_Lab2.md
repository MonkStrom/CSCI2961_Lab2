2) A license allows developers to decide how they want their code to be used, distributed and treated once released. This is important across the whole spectrum of "free". If a developer wants their program to be restrictive in distribution and modification after released, that needs to be stated clearly in their license. Likewise, if they wanted it to be open for redistributions and variations, an appropriate license needs to be chosen for that. 

3) Using a project that doesn't have an explicit license can lead to problems. Commonly, a project with no explicitly stated license defaults to being "all rights reserved". This means the project is extremely restrictive. If the creator of such a project wanted to, they could turn it into an legal mess if their project is used.

5) Linux was designed under the idea of being a free and open-source operating system, so it makese sense that it uses GPL v2. Under this license, other people are allowed to release their own versions of Linux as long as they're versions are also licensed under GPL v2. This makes all variations of Linux free. The license also restricts variations from applying sublicenes, so all variations are equally free.

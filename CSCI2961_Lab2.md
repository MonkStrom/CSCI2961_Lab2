2) A license allows developers to decide how they want their code to be used, distributed and treated once released. This is important across the whole spectrum of "free". If a developer wants their program to be restrictive in distribution and modification after released, that needs to be stated clearly in their license. Likewise, if they wanted it to be open for redistributions and variations, an appropriate license needs to be chosen for that. 

3) Using a project that doesn't have an explicit license can lead to problems. Commonly, a project with no explicitly stated license defaults to being "all rights reserved". This means the project is extremely restrictive. If the creator of such a project wanted to, they could turn it into an legal mess if their project is used.

4) From my interperation of the reading, it seems like Gopher failed because they approached licensing and users were wary of this as the product was not free (price-wise) already. On the other hand, HTTP was basically abandoned by CERN and was left to be picked up by users who wanted to. This claim makes sense. People were worried about having to pay for a restrictive service they would want to modify. This naturally draws people away from it. However, HTTP looked open and free with potential to be more so for a similar service as Gopher. Based on this interperation, I would agree with the claims.

5) Linux was designed under the idea of being a free and open-source operating system, so it makese sense that it uses GPL v2. Under this license, other people are allowed to release their own versions of Linux as long as they're versions are also licensed under GPL v2. This makes all variations of Linux free. The license also restricts variations from applying sublicenes, so all variations are equally free.

6) Project: Repository with a general game engine which users can add 
			their material to.
	License: MIT license

7) Developer: Apache/BSD --> Developer gets accredited, some royalties 
							 and no blame
   
   Company: LGPL --> Can make proprietary works without releasing the 
   					 source to that
   
   Common Good: GPL --> Everything that comes out of GPL can only be GPL

8) (As a class)

9) Personally, I'd okay with working on any project so long as I feel like a respectable amount of interest in the desired outcome. This is primarily so I can learn the technologies involved without getting too bored and unmotivated. Another reason being, I don't really have any ideas of my own that I feel like I can approach yet.
